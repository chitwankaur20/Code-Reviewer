Okay, let's review this snippet.

❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ **Undefined Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, nor are they passed
as parameters. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` if `a` and `b` are not globally defined (which is generally
discouraged).
* ❌ **Lack of Reusability**: The function currently relies on external variables, making it non-reusable and
unpredictable. Its behavior changes based on external state, violating the principle of pure functions.
* ❌ **Poor Function Signature**: A function named `sum` implies it should take values to sum as input. The current
signature provides no way to pass these values.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} num1 - The first number.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
// Input validation can be added here for robustness,
// e.g., if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') { throw new Error('Inputs must be numbers.'); }
return num1 + num2;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Clear Parameters**: The function now explicitly accepts `num1` and `num2` as parameters, defining its inputs
clearly.
* ✔ **Prevents Errors**: By using parameters, `ReferenceError` is avoided, and the function operates on known, passed
values.
* ✔ **Improved Reusability**: The function can now be called with any two numbers, making it highly reusable across
different parts of the codebase.
* ✔ **Enhanced Readability & Maintainability**: It's immediately clear what the function expects and what it does.
* ✔ **Proper Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value,
adhering to documentation best practices.
