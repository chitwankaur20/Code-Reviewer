Code Editor with AI-Powered Suggestions

This project is a web-based code editor that intelligently suggests changes and improvements to your code using the Gemini API. It leverages prompt engineering to generate accurate, context-aware code suggestions, making development faster and more efficient.

Features

Real-time code suggestions and improvements.

Context-aware recommendations powered by the Gemini API.

Built with JavaScript and React on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

Fully tested using Postman to ensure API reliability.

User-friendly interface with live code editing capabilities.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

API: Gemini API for code suggestion generation

Testing: Postman for API testing

How it Works

Users write code in the editor interface.

The editor sends the code to the backend, which interacts with the Gemini API.

Using prompt engineering, the API generates suggested improvements or fixes.

Suggestions are displayed in the editor for the user to review and apply.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/chitwankaur20/Code-Reviewer)>


Install backend dependencies:

cd Backend
npm install

Open the app in your browser and start coding with AI assistance.

Testing

Use Postman to test API endpoints and ensure the Gemini API integration works correctly.

Endpoints include code submission, suggestion retrieval, and user interaction logging.
